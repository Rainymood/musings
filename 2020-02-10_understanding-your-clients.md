To give them what they want. Often, a client does not even know what he want,
and what he wants is often not what he needs. Furthermore, you can't motivate
your clients if you don't know them!

Is the client always right? No. What the client wants is not what the client needs. 

--

The client is always right

The client may not always be right, but they are however always the client

The client always deserves to be treated as if he or she is important and his or her opinions needs and wants are worth your attention. 

but they need to feel their interests are maximally served, always, even if impractical.

4 Ps model 2 minutes or less

4 Ps:
- postion
    what is happening now, what i sthe context
        the current situation is that .. you are overwhelmed with work
- problem
    what is the issue
- proposal
    what are the problems
        I looked at ... X different options (see post it notes)
- proposition
    what do I recommend
        proactively communicate synchronously such as using dashboards, emails, etc. 

I looked at 3 different options

presentation in the 4Ps

interaction of presenting then to the room 

"secrets" => work hard, you have to work rly hard 

mistakes are opportunities for learning 

## Section 4

continuing of presentations 

we all gave pitches of 4P model. Interesting stuff. 

observation 

all motivation is intrinsic, you can not motivate people.

you can only create the environment to succeed

decided, D+D (decided + doing)

summary: 
* dealing with client problem
* 6 steps and techniques

1. identify the problem
2. diagnose the problem, root cause

techniques: 
    * language of ownership 
    * less than 12 words
    * smart
    * 5x why 
    * hasttle impact matrix


observation: having people share their goals/dreams does not feel weird, dont think differently of them. 

## Emails

- power of three messaging

repeat your message
repeat your message
repeat your message

123

education education education

if you only have one thing to say, say it three times

Structure: 
- acknowledgement
- 3 messages
- call to action 

I would write the call to action on top

Write an email

Dear JJ, 

First off all I want to thank you for this leadership workshop. I found it
highly valuable and will use its lessons for sure moving forward in my
career.

That being said, to really make a change at the client I need an
accountability partner. That's what I need from you. I will send you a weekly
report with a single situation and how I handled it differently thanks to
your lessons. All I need from you is a short 1-3 email back on how I handled
this situation and what you think you would've done differently. 

The details down below here are merely for reference and to shortly recap
some of the things that I learned in your workshop:

I learned that:
* One should ask open ended questions 
* What the client wants is not alway what the client needs
* How to define the problem in 12 words or less with ownership rules
* The why/why technique to drill down to the root cause
* Learned a 6-step solving plan
* Power of three emailing technique to write good emails

ENDING bla bla work together bla bla
