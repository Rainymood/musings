# Things you can always work on

A software project is a living construct, it is never "finished", merely
abandoned (paraphrasing Willem de Kooning).

When you are done with your (sprint) tasks there are always things you can
improve and work on.

Just like software, this list of things to work on is a living construct
which. In no particular order of importance:

* Help teammates finish their sprint tasks.
* Re-read the code, become intimately acquainted with the codebase. 
* Fix failing tests.
* Write more tests.
* Add extra logging. 
* Clean up code, refactor code into a cohesive style. 
* Fix `#techdebt` and `#fixlater` issues.
* Write/clean up documentation.
* Write tutorials for people unfamiliar with the project (PO/business owners/general public).
* Write technical guides for engineers on the project.
* Read about how to become a better coder/programmer/engineer. 
* Then apply these lessons to a small part of the codebase. 
* Think of ways how to improve the code.
* Think of all the tools at your disposal and how to improve/sharpen them. 
* Think of how to shorten the build-test-debug loop. 
* Think of how to shorten the CI/CD pipeline.
