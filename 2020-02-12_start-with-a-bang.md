## Explosion in a can

>Not quite what you're talking about but the best book on car mechanics I ever
read... 

>It was red, and textbook-sized, hardcover. Lots of drawings. It
literally started with an explosion in a can, and then progressively enhanced
that idea step-by-step: add a lid to the can to capture the energy, add a
lever to keep the can lid from flying away, and then attach the lever to a
wheel so that it returns the lid to the top of the can for another explosion,
add walls to guide the lid, ta-da! Piston.

>It goes on like that, adding each piece of the puzzle in a logical way, until
you have a mental model of an internal combustion engine. You definitely feel
like you could build one from scratch (if you had the metallurgy skill.)

* start with the cool part, generate interest and hook people in
* build up the mental model step by step, piece by piece, **slowly**. 

## Summary

This way of describing writing guides closely mirrors my own experience with
tutorials that I liked and disliked. 

Tutorials that really engage you just *feel* right. And I've been on a quest
to actually analyze and discover what it exactly is that makes it *feel
right*. 

Of course, I am not anywhere near claiming to have found the answer, but I did
discover some things. For me, the most important part is that **the reader is hooked in** with an engaging story or example or showcase. Then, the **mental model needs to be built up slowly but surely**.
