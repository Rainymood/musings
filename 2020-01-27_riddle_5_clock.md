# Puzzle #5: Degrees Between the Hands of a Clock

From [here](http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/)

## Problem

>5. How many degrees (if any) are there in the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock when the time is a quarter past three?

## Solution

The answer is 30/4 = 7.5 degrees

At 15:00 There is exactly a 90 degree angle. At 15:15 the minute traveled to the '3' on the clock and meanwhile the hour handle has moved 1/4th of an hour. There are 360/12=30 degrees between the '3' and '4' on the clock so hence the answer is 30/4=7.5 degrees.
