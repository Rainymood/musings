# What do junior data scientists often lack

I vividly remember my first couple of days, weeks, months as a data scientist.
This was before I had any "real" project experience. 

Here is a short and incomplete list of the things that I, personally, at that time in my career did and did not have.

🚀 What I did have: 

* Good math chops
* Lots of ambition
* Python + Jupyter notebook skills

🛠 What they lack: 

* Proper software collaboration (git, branches, tickets)
* General software principles (testing, functions, etc.)
* The know-how to move beyond Jupyter notebooks

## Summary

From [learn to build, learn to sell](https://nav.al/build-sell) by Naval:

>And usually the building is a thing that a sales person can’t pick up later
in life. It requires too much focused time. But a builder can pick up selling
a little bit later, especially if they were already innately wired to be a
good communicator. Bill Gates famously paraphrases this as, “I’d rather teach
an engineer marketing, than a marketer engineering.”

If you are an ambituous data scientist coming from an applied math
background, don't worry. You have a solid foundation. What you now need to
work on are your general software and teamwork skills and you'll be
unstoppable.
