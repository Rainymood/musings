# Riddle #7: Three Light Bulbs & Switches in a Room

From [here](http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/)

## Problem

>A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing
an identical light bulb or light globe. Each light is connected to one of
three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. You
are outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may
play around with the light switches as many times as you like. But once
you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. After this, you go
into the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to
which light?

## Solution

The answer to this is simple. 

Flip switch 1 and switch 2 on.

Wait a while for the bulbs to heat up. 

Flip switch 2 off and walk in. 

The bulb that is hot and on is switch 1. 

The bulb that is hot and off is switch 2. 

The bulb that is cold and off is switch 3.

## Concepts

**Information gathering and configurations**

Now that I've studied [Joe Z's] answer to the weighing problem with 12 balls
I suddenly view this problem differently. Again we can apply the same
"pattern". **How many pieces of information or configurations can we get with
the actions we are allowed?** 

The act of flipping the switch turns something on immediately, and has a
delayed effect of warming up the bulb. Each bulb can be either on or off, or
hot or cold. Hence in total we have 4 configurations with 3 bulbs.
