# Riddle #18: Mean of Consecutive Primes

From [here](http://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/)

## Problem

>Quickie: Can the mean of any two consecutive prime numbers ever be prime?

## Solution

First primes `1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ...`. The difference between any two primes (if neither of them is two) is always going to be even as the difference between two odd numbers is even. 

This problem has a simpler solution. The question asks "can two
**consecutive** primes ever be prime?" And the answer to that is no because
there can be nothing in between two consecutive things.

## Concepts

**Hidden assumptions** 

While finding the general solution is easy on this one, you always have to be wary of your hidden assumptions. In this case we want to solve the problem so badly we tend to overlook the obvious things mentioned in the text. 

**Critical thinking**

This one is a bit trivial, but still you need to exhibit some form of critical thinking to solve this one.
