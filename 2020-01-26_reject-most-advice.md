# Reject most advice

Came across [this](https://nav.al/reject-advice) really short (less than 3
minutes) and interesting podcast by Naval and Nivi.

## Transcript

>Nivi: One of the tweets from the cutting-room floor was: “Avoid people who
got rich quickly. They’re just giving you their winning lottery ticket
numbers.”

>Naval: This is generally true of most advice. It goes back to Scott
Adams—systems not goals. If you ask a successful person what worked for them,
they often read out the exact set of things that worked for them, which might
not apply to you. They’re just reading you their winning lottery ticket
numbers.

>It’s a little glib. There is something to be learned, but you can’t take
their exact circumstance and map it onto yours. The best founders I know read
and listen to everyone. But then they ignore everyone and make up their own
mind.

>They have their own internal model of how to apply things to their
situation. And they do not hesitate to discard information. If you survey
enough people, all of the advice will cancel to zero.

>You have to have your own point of view. When something is sent your way,
you have to quickly decide: Is it true? Is it true outside of the context of
how that person applied it? Is it true in my context? And then, Do I want to
apply it?

>You have to reject most advice. But you have to listen to enough of it, and
read enough of it, to know what to reject and what to accept.

>Even in this podcast, you should examine everything. If something doesn’t
feel true to you, put it down. Set it aside. If too many things seem untrue,
delete this podcast.

>Advice offers anecdotes to recall later, when you get your own experience

>Nivi: I think the most dangerous part of taking advice is that the person
who gave it to you isn’t going to be around to tell you when it doesn’t apply
any more.

>Naval: I view the purpose of advice a little differently than most people. I
view it as helping me have anecdotes and maxims that I can recall when I have
my own direct experience and say, “Ah, that’s what that person meant.”

>Ninety percent of my tweets are maxims that become mental hooks to remind me
when I’m in that situation again.

>Like, “Oh, I’m the one who tweeted, ‘If you can’t see yourself working with
someone for life, then don’t work with them for a day.’” As soon as I know
I’m not going to be working with someone 10 years from now, then I have to
start extricating myself from that relationship or investing less effort in
it.

>I use tweets to compress my own learnings. Your brain space is finite. You
have finite neurons. You can think of these as pointers, addresses, mnemonics
to help you remember deep-seated principles where you have the underlying
experience to back it up.

>If you don’t have the underlying experience, then it reads like a collection
of quotes. It’s cool. It’s inspirational for a moment. Maybe you make a nice
poster out of it. But then you forget it and move on.

>These are compact ways for you to recall your own knowledge.
