# You won't get rich renting our your time


**WIP DRAFT**

## Disclaimer

On a personal level, it feels really weird to make these kind of points about
"wanting to get rich" and "how to get rich". Perhaps it is the environment
that I've been raised in but I feel kind of queasy making these kind of
posts/musings.

However, on a deep level I believe that ambition is good and that we should
never fear our own ambition. You want to get that job you love? Go get it! You want that
house? Go for it! You want to find the love of your life? Go get em
tiger! You wanna get rich? Go for it! 

Matter of fact is, I would still like to get rich. I don't think it is
inherently "bad" to want to get rich. Truth be told, it is not money that we
seek, it is freedom. Money won't solve all your problems but it will solve
your money problems (and there are many money problems).

Anyway, enough self-flagellation for wanting to get rich and free, here's why
you won't get rich renting our your time.

## You are not going to get rich renting out your time

## You must own a piece of business

Reasons why you probably won't get rich renting our your time: 
* The most basic reason is that your inputs are very closely tied to your
outputs. 
* In almost any salaried job, even at one that’s paying a lot per hour
like a lawyer, or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour
you get paid.
    * So, what that means is when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning.
    * When you’re retired, you’re not earning. 
    * When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And
    you can’t earn non-linearly.

* If you look at even doctors who get rich, like really rich, it’s because they
open a business. They open like a private practice. And that private practice
builds a brand, and that brand attracts people. Or they build some kind of a
medical device, or a procedure, or a process with an intellectual property.

So, essentially you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking
on the risk, and has the accountability, and the intellectual property, and
the brand. So, they’re just not gonna pay you enough. They’re gonna pay you
the bare minimum that they have to, to get you to do their job. And that can
be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not gonna be true wealth where you’re
retired.

* Renting out your time means you’re essentially replaceable

And then finally you’re actually just not even creating that much original
for society. Like I said, this tweetstorm should have been called “How to
Create Wealth.” It’s just “How to Get Rich” was a more catchy title. But
you’re not creating new things for society. You’re just doing things over and
over.

And you’re essentially replaceable because you’re now doing a set role. Most
set roles can be taught. If they can be taught like in a school, then
eventually you’re gonna be competing with someone who’s got more recent
knowledge, who’s been taught, and is coming in to replace you.

You’re much more likely to be doing a job that can be eventually replaced by
a robot, or by an AI. And it doesn’t even have to be wholesale replaced over
night. It can be replaced a little bit at a time. And that kind of eats into
your wealth creation, and therefore your earning capability.

## You must disconneown a piece of business

* You must own equity to gain your financial freedom
    * So everybody who really makes money at some point owns a piece of a product,
    or a business, or some kind of IP. That can be through stock options, so you
    can be working at a tech company. That’s a fine way to start.
    * But usually the real wealth is created by starting your own companies, or by
    even investors. They’re in an investment firm, and they’re buying equity.
    These are much more the routes to wealth. It doesn’t come through the hours.
* Seek a career where your inputs do not match your ouputs.
    * How? Tools and leverage create the disconnection between inputs and outputs. 
        * Example: A computer is a tool that software engineers use. If I’m a lumberjack with
        bulldozers, and automatic robot axes, and saws, I’m gonna be using tools, and
        have more leverage than someone who is just using his bare hands, and trying
        to rip the trees out by the roots.
        * For example, look at software engineering. One great engineer can for example
        create bitcoin, and create billions of dollars worth of value. And an
        engineer who is working on the wrong thing, or not quite as good, or just not
        as creative, or thoughtful, or whatever, can work for an entire a year, and
        every piece of code they ship ends up not getting used. Customers don’t want
        it.
